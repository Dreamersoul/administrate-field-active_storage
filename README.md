## Things To Know:
- To preview pdf files you need to install `mupdf` or `Poppler`.
- To preview video files you need to install `ffmpeg`.
- To preview Office files as pictures you need to install [activestorage-office-previewer](https://github.com/basecamp/activestorage-office-previewer) by basecamp

## How To Use:
Add `administrate-field-active_storage` and `image_processing` to your Gemfile (Rails 6+):

```ruby
gem "administrate-field-active_storage"
gem "image_processing"
```

for Rails 5.x use the following
```ruby
gem "administrate-field-active_storage", "0.1.8"
```

Install:

```
$ bundle install
```

### `has_one_attached`:
Assuming your model name is `Model` and field name is `attachment`
```ruby
class ModelDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    attachment: Field::ActiveStorage,
  }
# ...
```
Then add `:attachment` to `FORM_ATTRIBUTES` and `SHOW_PAGE_ATTRIBUTES`.
Adding `:attachment` `COLLECTION_ATTRIBUTES` will work but will probably look too big.

### `has_many_attached`:
Assuming your model name is `Model` and field name is `attachments` the process is identical the only issue is that the form field isn't being permitted, in order to permit it we apply the following method to the dashboard:

```ruby
class ModelDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    attachments: Field::ActiveStorage,
  }

  # ...
  FORM_ATTRIBUTES = {
    #...
    :attachments
  }

  # permitted for has_many_attached
  def permitted_attributes
    super + [:attachments => []]
  end
```
I know it is not ideal, if you have a workaround please submit a PR.

Note: Rails 6 introduced a new config to determine the behavior on updates to `has_many_attached`.  Setting `Rails.application.config.active_storage.replace_on_assign_to_many` to `true` will overwrite any existing values (purging the old ones), and setting it to `false` will append the new values.

### Prevent N+1 queries
In order to prevent N+1 queries from active storage you have to modify your admin model controller, below an example for a model called `User` and with attached avatars
```ruby
module Admin
  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    def scoped_resource
      resource_class.with_attached_avatars
    end
  end
end
```

### Removing/Deleting an Attachment

`Administrate::Field::ActiveStorage` expects the presence of a route
DELETE `/<namespace>/<resource>/:id/:attachment_name`, which will receive an optional parameter
`attachment_id` in the case of an `ActiveStorage::Attached::Many`. For instance:

```rb
# routes.rb
...
namespace :admin do
  ...
  resources :users do
    delete :avatars, on: :member, action: :destroy_avatar
  end
end

# app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb
module Admin
  class UsersController < ApplicationController

    # For illustrative purposes only.
    #
    # **SECURITY NOTICE**: first verify whether current user is authorized to perform the action.
    def destroy_avatar
      avatar = requested_resource.avatars.find(params[:attachment_id])
      avatar.purge
      redirect_back(fallback_location: requested_resource)
    end
  end
end
```
For `has_one_attached` cases, you will use:

```rb
# routes.rb
...
namespace :admin do
  ...
  resources :users do
    delete :avatar, on: :member, action: :destroy_avatar
  end
end

# app/controllers/admin/users_controller.rb
module Admin
  class UsersController < ApplicationController

    # For illustrative purposes only.
    #
    # **SECURITY NOTICE**: first verify whether current user is authorized to perform the action.
    def destroy_avatar
      avatar = requested_resource.avatar
      avatar.purge
      redirect_back(fallback_location: requested_resource)
    end
  end
end
```
This route can be customized with `destroy_url`. The option expects a `proc` receiving 3 arguments:
the Administrate `namespace`, the `resource`, and the `attachment`. The proc can return anything
accepted by `link_to`:

```rb
# routes.rb
delete :custom_user_avatar_destroy, to: 'users#destroy_avatar'

# user_dashboard.rb
class UserDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    avatars: Field::ActiveStorage.with_options(
      destroy_url: proc do |namespace, resource, attachment|
        [:custom_user_avatar_destroy, { attachment_id: attachment.id }]
      end
    ),
    # ...
  end
  # ...
end
```

## Options

Various options can be passed to `Administrate::Field::ActiveStorage#with_options`
as illustrated below:

```rb
class ModelDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    attachments: Field::ActiveStorage.with_options(index_display_preview: false),
    # ...
  }
  # ...
end
```

### show_display_preview

Display attachment preview.

Defaults to `true`.

### index_display_preview

Displays the first attachment (which is the only attachment in case of `has_one`)
in the `index` action.

Defaults to `true`.

### index_preview_size and show_preview_size

Indicate the size of the image preview for the `index` and `show` actions, respectively.
Refer to [mini_magic#resize_to_limit](https://github.com/janko/image_processing/blob/master/doc/minimagick.md#methods)
for documentation.

Default to `[150, 150]` and `[800, 800]`, respectively.

### index_preview_variant and show_preview_variant

Use a named variant for image preview for the `index` and `show` actions, respectively.
Named image variants were [added in Rails 7](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.0/active_storage_overview.html#has-one-attached).

It might be necessary to add to app/assets/config/manifest.js:
```rb
 //= link 'administrate-field-active_storage/application.css'
```
When set, this takes precedence over `index_preview_size` and `show_preview_size`.

### index_display_count

Displays the number of attachments in the `index` action.

Defaults to `true` if number of attachments is not 1.

### direct_upload

Enables direct upload from the browser to the cloud.

Defaults to `false`.

Don't forget to include [ActiveStorage JavaScript](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#direct-uploads). You can use `rails generate administrate:assets:javascripts` to be able to customize Administrate JavaScripts in your application.
