# Administrate::Field::ActiveStorage
![rails](https://img.shields.io/badge/rails-%3E%3D5.2.0-red.svg)

## Things To Know:
- To preview pdf files you need to install `mupdf` or `Poppler`.
- To preview video files you need to install `ffmpeg`.

## How To Use:
Add `administrate-field-active_storage` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'administrate-field-active_storage'
```

Install:

```
$ bundle install
```

### `has_one_attached`:
Assuming your model name is `Model` and field name is `attachment`
```ruby
class ModelDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    attachment: Field::ActiveStorage,
  }
# ...
```
Then add `:attachment` to `FORM_ATTRIBUTES` and `SHOW_PAGE_ATTRIBUTES`.
Adding `:attachment` `COLLECTION_ATTRIBUTES` will work but will probably look too big.

### `has_many_attached`:
Assuming your model name is `Model` and field name is `attachments` the processs is identical the only issue is that the form field isn't being permitted, in order to permit it we apply the following method to the dashboard:

```ruby
class ModelDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    attachments: Field::ActiveStorage,
  }

  # ...
  FORM_ATTRIBUTES = {
    #...
    :attachments
  }

  # permitted for has_many_attached
  def permitted_attributes
    super + [:attachments => []]
  end
```
I know it is not ideal, if you have a workaround please submit a PR.

### url_only
Only the following needs to change in order for the field to be url_only
```ruby
class ModelDashboard < Administrate::BaseDashboard
  ATTRIBUTE_TYPES = {
    attachments: Field::ActiveStorage.with_options({url_only: true}),
    # ...
  }
  # ...
end
```
